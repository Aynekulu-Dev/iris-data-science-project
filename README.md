# Iris Regression Analysis
This project explores linear regression on the Iris dataset to predict petal dimensions (width) using sepal measurements. It includes data visualization, model training, cross-validation, and residual analysis.
Added a 3D scatter plot to visualize the polynomial regression model in three dimensions.
Included synthetic data to test model robustness and generalizability.
